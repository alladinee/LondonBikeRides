# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed the London bike rides dataset. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and Tableau for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about bike rides in London, including the duration, start/end stations, and user demographics. The dataset was obtained from [[source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)] .

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- Tableau: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Project Files
- `JupyterNotebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `TableauDashboard.twb`: The Tableau workbook containing the interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, formatting columns, and removing outliers if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and uncover insights.
3. Visualization: Used Tableau to create interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and maps to visualize key findings.
4. Insights and Interpretation: Summarized the findings and interpreted the results obtained from the analysis.

## Results and Findings
- Key findings from the analysis, such as popular bike stations, peak usage times, and user demographics.
- Insights regarding bike usage patterns, user behavior, or any interesting trends discovered.

## Future Work
- Possible areas for further analysis or improvement in the project.
- Suggestions for additional features, data sources, or techniques that could enhance the analysis.

## Conclusion
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of London bike rides data, exploring patterns and trends using Jupyter Notebook and visualizing the insights using Tableau. The findings provide valuable information about bike usage in the city and can be used for various purposes, such as optimizing bike infrastructure, improving user experience, and informing decision-making.
