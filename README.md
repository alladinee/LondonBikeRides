# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed the London bike rides dataset. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and Tableau for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about bike rides in London, including the humidity, temperature, and timestamp. The dataset was obtained from [[London bike sharing dataset
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)] .

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- Tableau: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Project Files
- `JupyterNotebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `TableauDashboard.twb`: The Tableau workbook containing the interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, formatting columns, and removing outliers if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and uncover insights.
3. Visualization: Used Tableau to create interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and maps to visualize key findings.
4. Insights and Interpretation: Summarized the findings and interpreted the results obtained from the analysis.
